Pinboard Linkroll
=================

This WordPress plugin showcases a pinboard.in linkroll as a widget. The feeds of multiple pinboard.in users can be merged and filtered by their tags.

## Why another one?

Yes, WordPress has a core RSS widget, there's a [plethora of plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=rss+widget) and there's a bunch of [single purpose tools](https://pinboard.in/resources/) for integrating Pinboard feeds into WordPress. But after checking them (at least, some of them) i found no solution with my desired feature set â€“ so i decided to build one myself.

## Features

* display one or multiple pinboard.in users rss feeds
* filter by their tags
* complete control over markup and styling
* customizable cache lifetime

## Customization

At the moment there are 3 filter hooks for customizing Pinboard Linkroll without having to fork it.

### `pinboard_linkroll_cache_lifetime( $seconds )`

The plugin uses WordPress' fetch_feed(), which uses the WordPress Transients API with a default lifetime of 12 hours. if, for testing purposes or frequent updates, this is to be changed, it can be done from the theme's `functions.php`:

  function change_pinboard_linkroll_cache_lifetime( $seconds ) {
    return 1800;
  }
  add_filter( 'pinboard_linkroll_cache_lifetime', 'change_pinboard_linkroll_cache_lifetime' );

### `pinboard_linkroll_template( $path )`

The default template of the plugin uses Bootstrap's [List group](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#list-group) markup, however to override the template with a path (which has to be relative to the active theme's path), paste the following into the theme's `functions.php`: 

  function change_pinboard_linkroll_template( $path ) {
    return 'templates/widget-pinboard-linkroll.php';
  }
  add_filter( 'pinboard_linkroll_template', 'change_pinboard_linkroll_template' );

### `pinboard_linkroll_css( $path )`

By default the plugin loads it's own css file. To prevent loading additional css altogether, paste the following into the theme's `functions.php`: 

  function change_pinboard_linkroll_css( $path ) {
    return false;
  }
  add_filter( 'pinboard_linkroll_css', 'change_pinboard_linkroll_css' );

The filter hook also takes a path to a css file relative to the active theme's path, which it will load instead of the default file.
